## Features 
- Using `verilator` for simulation
- Using `gtkwave` to view the .gtk file generated by the simulation
- Establish infrastructure and simple gdb. Can trace simulations base on instructions, memory, functions, devices and exceptions.
- Support difftest with `nemu`. Plan to support difftest with `spike` in the future.
- Supports simulation of simple peripheral devices such as timers, serial ports and vga.
